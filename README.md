# ML4SCi-Projects
Machine Learning for Scientific Applications: Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Simulations, and AI for Geoscience and Space


This repository contains a collection of personal and academic projects at the intersection of **machine learning** and **scientific research**, developed as part of my learning journey and participation in initiatives such as **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025**.

These projects explore the application of AI to physics, geosciences, climate, and space science. My goal is to contribute to open-source tools that support science, sustainability, and innovation in critical areas such as Earth monitoring, simulation, and planetary research.

## Projects

### `GSoC2025-PINNDE-CGD/`
Physics-Informed Neural Network to approximate the solution to a reverse-time diffusion equation via a test case: the damped harmonic oscillator. Submitted as part of the GSoC 2025 evaluation for ML4Sci.

*Coming soon: more structured projects and experiments based on gravitational data, cloud motion, or exoplanet prediction models.*
